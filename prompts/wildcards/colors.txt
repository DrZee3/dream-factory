# Dream Factory example wildcard file
#
# You can refer to this wildcard by putting __colors__ in your prompt files (two underscores, followed 
# by the filename without the .txt extension, followed by two more underscores). One of the below entries 
# will be picked at random and inserted into your prompt in its place.
# 
# For example, if your prompt is: "children playing with a __colors__ ball", Dream Factory will replace
# "__colors__" with one of the six colors below when the prompt is processed!
#
# Any .txt files you place here will be available in Dream Factory for use!
